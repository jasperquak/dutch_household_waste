    "# Dutch Household Waste\n",
    "\n",
    "Among many environmental issues that the world is facing these days, \"waste\" is one of them. In this study I am going to explore and analyze data about Dutch household waste in the period 2001-2020.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data sources\n",
    "\n",
    "Most data that I will use was published by the Dutch [CBS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics_Netherlands) (Centraal Bureau voor de Statistiek, or \"Central Agency for Statistics\"), a Dutch governmental institution that gathers statistical information about the Netherlands. Which is published on their website, [in Dutch](https://www.cbs.nl/) and [in English](https://www.cbs.nl/en-gb). \n",
    "\n",
    "A bit of supplementary data was taken from [Afvalmonitor](https://afvalmonitor.databank.nl/), or \"Waste Monitor\", another website regarding Dutch household waste.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Study topics and hypotheses\n",
    "\n",
    "In the [CBS section with data about household waste](https://opendata.cbs.nl/statline/portal.html?_catalog=CBS&_la=nl&tableId=83452NED&_theme=305), from which I will be downloading a lot of data, one can already see many numbers in a (configurable) [tabular format](https://opendata.cbs.nl/statline/#/CBS/nl/dataset/83452NED/table?ts=1664967262059), and with some effort even in graphical format. I obviously do not have the intention to replicate that (although for some key statistics I may). Rather, I want to explore things that you cannot see there:\n",
    "* trends over time around household waste\n",
    "* relationships with other data, e.g. demographic data of Dutch municipalities\n",
    "\n",
    "Some things that I am wondering and will be exploring:\n",
    "* At one hand, with rising prosperity, the amount of waste may have grown. At the other hand, with the increased environmental awareness, the amount of waste may have gone down. Which of those is the case?\n",
    "* There is a lot attention for separating waste these days. Is at least the amount of non-recycleble household waste going down?\n",
    "* Are there big differences between municipalities, and are there correlations with demographic information (e.g. urban vs rural, household income)?\n",
    "* These days, there are municipalities where for a household, the waste collection costs depends on the amount of waste. Can we see an impact?\n",
    "\n",
    "I do not know entirely what to expect, but if I have to formulate things as a hypothesis, then I expect (or maybe I should say: hope) to see:\n",
    "* that total household waste is at least not going up\n",
    "* that non-recycable household waste is decreasing\n",
    "* that a pricing system that depends on the amount of waste has a positive impact\n",
    "\n",
    "### Structure of this notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "This study notebook contains four main sections (after this introduction)\n",
    "1. **Data usability check.** Import of the data, some initial exploration and cleaning, concluding that the data is suitable for the purpose.\n",
    "2. **Data cleaning.** Further exploration and cleaning of the data, to prepare for the actual data analysis.\n",
    "3. **Data analysis.** Creation of tables, and especially graphs, related to the study topics, including observations and conclusions.\n",
    "4. **Summary and conclusions.** A brief summary of the Data analysis section, and suggested next steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "For those who are only interested in the results, you can basically go to section 3 straightaway, and within that section focus on the graphs and the text below them in particular.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first two sections are relevant for those who want to have a deeper understanding of the data, and/or want to validate my work.\n",
    "\n",
    "All sections contain multiple (numbered) sub-sections for further structuring.\n",
    "\n",
    "### About language and knowledge of the Netherlands\n",
    "\n",
    "The original data is in Dutch (which is my native language), and so is most of the websites from which the data was collected. To make this study readable for a non-Dutch speaking audience, parts of the data have been translated to English.\n",
    "\n",
    "For some sections of the study, comparisons are made between different Dutch municipalities. This may be easier to follow for an audience that knows the Netherlands. Some explanations, e.g. characteristics of selected municipalities, have been included though.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Technical preparations\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple Python libraries will be used during this study. Let's import them here."

    "While it is interesting to see, we must be very careful to draw too many conclusions from such a small selection. Without knowing (or speculating about) a cause, good to see the gradual decline over the years. For the rise in 2020, a possible explanation may be the covid-19 pandemic. It was on the news back then that lots of people used the lockdowns to clear out their houses.\n",

By combining the 'per-person' numbers that we have for the municipalities with the population-sizes for those municipalities. And then calculating values for the entire country - while acknowledging that missing data will give numbers that are too low."

    "That looks positive as such. We must be very careful with drawing any conclusions. First, we did not test whether the observed difference is statistically significant. (My gut feeling given the numbers says it does, but e.g. a chi-squared test could be useful.)\n",

    "\n",
    "* Total household waste per person peaked in the first years of the century, then gradually declined, however was on the rise again in 2020.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Residual waste is the biggest fraction, but has decreased during this period.\n",
    "\n",
    "* There are large differences between different municipalities. Both in terms of total waste, and also when looking at a breakdown in types of waste.\n",
    "\n",
    "* One observation (but explicitly not implying a cause) is that large, densily populated municipalities (cities) have less waste per person than less densily populated municipalities. However, the high amounts of organic waste in 'greener' areas could be an explanation of that.\n",
    "\n",
    "* There is an indication that a pricing system that depends on the amount of waste has a positive impact.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data allows for further analysis, there is much more to explore. In particular for more firm conclusions about influential factors for what waste is collected, more study would be required. It may also require different data sources."
